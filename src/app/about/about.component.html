	We are an indie rock band in the Twin Cities, MN area comprised of Josh Busch, Aaron Sands, and Blake Pieper.

	The three of us started playing music together in late 2018. We all have pretty busy lives, but always try to make time to jam together, usually on weeknights and weekends. We started out playing mostly covers, but slowly built up a repertoire of original songs. We released our first EP "In the Morning" in late 2019 after working on it in Josh's garage.
